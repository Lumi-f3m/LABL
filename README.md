## 🚀 Open Unblocked

The entire launcher is contained in a single HTML file, making it easy to use and deploy.

### **Method 1: Local Use**

1.  Download the whole file and put it in a folder (named anything)
2.  Open the index.html (and click the clever badge) or open the main.html file

### **Method 2: Deployment (For a website version)**

If Method one is blocked for you, you can use either **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

### Netlify
1.  **Go to Netlify:** Visit the Netlify website and create a free account.
2.  **Drag and Drop:** On your Netlify dashboard, simply drag and drop your files into the designated area.
3.  **Get Your URL:** Netlify will automatically deploy your site and provide a unique URL (e.g., `random-name.netlify.app`), which is often unblocked by school filters.

### Vercel
1. **Fork this Repository** Go to this GitHub repo and fork it to your account.
2. **Deploy** Sign In/Up and add a new GitHub repo and deploy.
3. **Get your URL** Get your url (e.g., `labl.vercel.app`)
